//! This module contains an implementation of local storage for eBPF programs
//! running in the system. The local storage is represented as a key-value
//! storage that belongs to a given program.
//!
//! What is meant by 'belongs to' is that before being executed, each program
//! gets written into a SUIT storage slot using the infrastructure provided by
//! RIOT. At the same time, a static BTreeMap for that program is initialised.
//! This means that the local storage of a given program will persist as long as
//! its bytecode remains loaded in the same SUIT storage slot.
//!
//! It is important to note that before we execute an instance of the VM, we
//! actually load the program from the SUIT storage into a slice on the current
//! thread's stack. This means that there is nothing that enforces that the local
//! storage needs to be coupled with the SUIT slot. This design was chosen because
//! of its simplicity. We could for instance provide thread-local storage but that
//! could lead to issues as different worker threads can be chosen to execute
//! a program loaded into some SUIT storage slot.
//!
//! To make the explanation more explicit, after the program is loaded into a
//! given SUIT storage slot, it can be executed multiple times and possibly even
//! concurrently. This is because we always copy programs bytecode before executing it.
//!
